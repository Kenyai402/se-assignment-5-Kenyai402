    -Set breakpoints (lines where the code execution pauses) by clicking next to the line number in the editor.
    -Start debugging using the Debug view in the Activity Bar. You can then step through your code line-by-line, inspect variables, and identify the source of errors.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

    Integrating Git with VS Code for version control:
      Git is a version control system that tracks changes to your code over time.
      1. Install Git-Before integrating Git with VS Code, you need to have Git installed on your system.
        -Download: Visit the official Git website and download the installer for your operating system.
        -Install: Run the installer and follow the setup wizard to complete the installation.
        -Verify Installation: Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and type git --version to verify that Git is installed correctly.
      2. Open VS Code and Initialize a Git Repository
        -Open Your Project: Open VS Code and open the folder containing your project files.
        -Initialize Git: Open the Source Control view by clicking the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by using the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+G. If your project folder is not already a Git repository, you will see an option to Initialize Repository. Click on this to initialize a new Git repository in your project folder.
      3. Making Commits
        -Stage Changes: After making changes to your files, go to the Source Control view. You will see a list of modified files. Click the + icon next to each file to stage the changes. Alternatively, you can stage all changes at once by clicking the + icon at the top.
        -Commit Changes: Once you have staged your changes, you can commit them by entering a commit message in the message box at the top of the Source Control view and then clicking the checkmark icon (âœ“) or pressing Ctrl+Enter to commit the changes.
      4. Connect to GitHub
        -Create a Repository on GitHub: Go to GitHub, log in to your account, and create a new repository. Note the repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/username/repo.git).
       -Add Remote Repository: In VS Code, open the terminal (use Ctrl+ `` (backtick) or go to View > Terminal). Add the GitHub repository as a remote by running the following command:
       'git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git'
       -Replace https://github.com/username/repo.git with the URL of your GitHub repository.
       -Push Changes: To push your committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub, run:
       'git push -u origin master'
       -This command pushes your changes to the master branch of the remote repository. If you're working on a different branch, replace master with your branch name.
      5. Managing Source Control in VS Code
       -Branching: You can create and manage branches in VS Code. In the Source Control view, click the ellipsis (...) menu and select Branch > Create Branch to create a new branch. You can switch branches by selecting Branch > Checkout to.
       -Pulling Changes: To pull the latest changes from the remote repository, open the terminal and run:
       'git pull origin master'
       -Replace master with your branch name if needed.
